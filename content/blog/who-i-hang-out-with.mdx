I try to maintain a lot of relationships and it got to the point where I 
needed a way to remember who I hung out with and who I still need to see.
A simple list of names would not satisfy me. I needed a visual. 

I started by building a widget.

## The Pipeline

The pipeline for this project from hangout to widget is a little bit convoluted.

1. An Apple shortcut saves a name(s) to a .csv file on my iCloud
2. Each night, a python script on my Mac reads the .csv file and creates an image (the widget)
3. My Mac replaces the last day's image with the new one in a one-photo-only photo album
4. My phone uses a photo widget to display the album, displaying the last day's hangouts

Behind the scenes, there's a lot of silly interactions just to make the widget work.
Firstly, the widget is barely a widget. It's a photo album.
Secondly, the widget requires my laptop to process data that will start and end on my phone. 
That being said, there are a lot of nice user experiences I left for myself in this project.
The user (me) only has to click a widget on my home screen to add a name to the list.
What ended up being helpful was that now I know when I forget to log a hangout.
The prior day would be unexpectedly empty!

## Designing the Widget

I knew I wanted to display some sense of periodicity.
I'm a creature of habit. Some people I see every week, some people I see every month.
Some on Tuesdays, some sporadically.
This was my main design concept for this visualization.

A first natural idea was to display a heatmap of people I see, 
as a sort of calendar.
I wanted to provide some individuality to the data, so my first attempt
had a list of names vertically and highlighted a day if I hung out with that person.
This resulted in an ugly stack of names with boxes that were mostly empty.
Even my closest friends looked distant with 5+ empty boxes between weekly hangouts.
In a widget, with limited space, there was no way to display this as a heatmap.

Another idea was to make a graph, where nodes are people and edges are whether
I saw them on the same day.
This sounded like a good idea, but when I finally implemented it, it didn't show the
relationships I wanted it to.
I hoped that it could somehow reveal the relationships and groups of the people I see,
but really it just highlighted days of the week.
People that had never met were closely grouped together,
because I would regularly see some people in the afternoon and others in the evening.
This too was a dead end.

The driving design concept for the final image was to display a timeline of sorts.
I realized that I could display a month as a spiraling timeline, where days of the week
line up with the same angle.
Then, I could see which days I hung out with the most people and who I'm hanging out with each day.
I had older days towards the center of the widget, like a tunnel through time.
Days where I saw more people would dynamically jitter the dots more,
allowing each person to still be individually visible (though unidentifiable).
Knowing that the final target was to make a widget, some other design decisions were made.
I couldn't include a legend with a ton of names, so I decided to highlight only a couple of names each day.
This was a great idea, as now the visualization gave me something to focus on.
This had another positive side effect, I could now use that random list of names
to remind me to reach out to people I haven't seen or thought about in a while.

## Reflection

I'm proud of the final product.
It's something I get to use every day and it has been a great way to keep track of my relationships.
Knowing that I had a final product made the process a lot more design-centric.
I needed to continuously balance the visualization's user experience alongside
its ability to display the data.
The silly interactions between my phone and my laptop give it a lot of charm that
no one would necessarily know about on first glance.
Overall, the project is one that I am eager to show people and it only took a few hours to build.
