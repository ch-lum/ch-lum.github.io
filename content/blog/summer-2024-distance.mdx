With my graduation date set as March 2025 and a hopeful job soon after,
this summer may be my last summer break.
I got the opportunity to travel far and wide; from Hawaii and New York and Barcelona and Athens.
Similarly, my girlfriend got to travel a bit too!
This was our first time being apart for so long and an additional, unseen challenege
was the constantly changing timezones.
*Lets call at 10. Oh, I meant my 10. 10pm. My time.*
After dinner, before lunch, the depths of the night, really anything was possible.

The following is a day-by-day visualization of the timezone distance between us.

Even through all of our travels, on average, we were only 20 minutes apart.
In a way, we were never really that far apart (just ignore standard deviation).
