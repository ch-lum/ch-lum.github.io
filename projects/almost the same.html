									<p><strong>September 6, 2022</strong><br>Christopher Lum</p> <!-- Date -->

									<p>What started as a simple game on a walk, <i>Almost the Same</i> took me on a journey into graphs and data viz in an unexpected first project. Despite some terrible code and questionable decisions, I came out of this project by getting my hands dirty in the very essence of data science and exploratory data analysis.</p>

									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>A strange fondness for words started in one of two places years ago: either on YouTube by pretending to be a linguist—watching video after video on conlangs, or an addiction to the iMessage Game Pigeon game, Word Hunt. Which came first isn’t entirely certain, but what persevered was a curiosity for the structure of English and a knack for word games.</p>
									<p>We came up with this game on a walk (as we would later discover, this wasn’t some brand new game, and people had been playing it before us—bummer!). The goal was to connect two words, for example ROAD and NAME, with words that contain all but one letter in common—both the letter itself and its position. With ROAD, we could jump to either TOAD or ROAM. This game entertained us for the better part of a half hour, and we were beginning to pick up on some strategies. It’s hard to move vowels around, so multi-lettered sounds did a lot of work for us. Additionally, the game was almost always doable with four letters, but was much more difficult with five. Maybe we just weren’t that good!</p>

									<h2>Why do it in your head?</h2>
									<p>On a road trip, we showed this game to our friend John. He wasn’t great at the game (sorry!) but together we started wondering how we could code an algorithm to solve these for us. Once we got home, we agreed to work on it for the night and come back in the morning and see what solutions we had for each other. Before we parted, we discussed some ways that we could come up with a solution together. I proposed using a tree to comb through every single combination and eventually reach the target word. He mentioned that a graph would be easier and that’s actually what I was looking for, so I took his advice and carried it into my code that night. </p>
									<h2>Forbidden code</h2>
									<p>I lied straight to your face. I did not use a graph; I used a tree instead. <i>The following code discussion is highly confidential</i>. What is going to be discussed is radioactive can cause headaches and nausea in some readers. Tread carefully, and if you don’t feel comfortable, you are free to skip to the next header where logic and reasoning return and the code is actually formidable and not a huge pile of spaghetti.</p>
									<p>With that warning out of the way, I can reveal bits of my first strategy. I used a tree. There was so much redundancy in terms of how many times I run the similar-ness method. There was so much redundancy in terms of how many times I tested any word as a step in the path. To get from ROAD to NAME, my algorithm looked at hundreds of thousands of words and took over five minutes. There are around 3400 four letter words in my dictionary. I left the code on the GitHub repo if you want to cry yourself to sleep.</p>
									<p>I showed John my strategy, and he couldn’t even think of how I made my code so slow. Fortunately, John’s first version was also far from optimal and came up with solutions with millions of words in the path, so who was really on top?</p>
									<h2>Gee, I love graphs!</h2>
									<p> At some point, I thought to myself, probably while waiting for my other code to run, <i>what if I just put it all into a graph?</i> as if John hadn’t told me that from the get-go. I go ahead and learn about the NetworkX library and dive right in. There’s a shortest path function built right in! Perfect! Now my code runs at lightning speed, and I finally feel satisfied with the algorithm (unlike with stupid trees). Well, quest complete! I now have an optimized (enough) algorithm to do what I wanted from the start, but this was just the beginning.</p>
									<p>A quick aside before we dive into the next part, I told John what I had done, and he said something along the lines of “What? Where’s the fun in that! You were supposed to code the algorithm, not just use a function!” I think we have different ideas of fun. The fun was just about to start. We’re going to visualize it.</p>

									<h2>All the fun!</h2>
									<p>Alright fast forward, and I discovered a program called Gephi and now I’m ready to press some buttons and make stuff happen. It took a couple hours, but eventually I got the hang of it.</p>
									<p>Take a look for yourself first! Here’s two different layouts to look at: <a href="almost the same/circlepack/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circle pack</a>, <a href="almost the same/forceatlas2/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">force atlas 2</a></p>
									<p>In the circle pack layout, seeing how words settle into communities was fascinating, where words connect mostly within their own communities and few connections lead out. Shortest paths within communities are generally pretty quick and shortest paths between communities are generally longer.</p>
									<p> Despite this, in four and five-letter word networks, there are no large and isolated communities (>20 words and no edges to the main network) forming. In the six-letter word network, we finally see words that form distinct networks from each other—The main one primarily ending with -es, -ed, -en, and the other ending with -ing. </p>
									<p>Another interesting thing is that in the four-letter word network, over 98% of the words are somehow connected to the main network. Crazy! And a lot of the words that aren’t connected are words I don’t really recognize that made it into the dictionary I was using. That explains why the game in four letters always seemed doable—because it was!</p>
									<p>Alright, but what about five-letter words? Was I just bad at the game, or do most words just not connect? In the five-letter word network, 77% of words are connected. This means when playing with a five-letter words, there’s about a one-in-four chance your game is just impossible to end. Definitely seemed like more when I was playing!</p>
									<p>Let’s dive a little more into the four-letter word network. What is the longest shortest path? Or in other words, what is the diameter of the network? Well, the average shortest path length is around 5.5 words; The longest path in the network, however, is a whopping 20 words long! A fun coincidence is that one of those edges is the word EDGE! Less fun is that the other end is the Roman numeral VIII, which somehow snuck into the library. There is a 19-long path between EDGE and EVIL though, so close enough.</p>
									<blockquote>Edge → edgy → eddy → edda → edna → erna → erma → elma → alma → alms → ales → oles → odes → odis → obis → obit → omit → emit → emil → evil</blockquote>
									<p>I’m not entirely sure about most of those words (and neither is autocorrect), but that’s what you get when you use a giant dictionary and are looking for outliers. I did leave implementation to change the dictionary used, however, so perhaps finer tuning is possible to make results you can always be happy with.</p>
									<p>Here’s a question: What word has the most connections? In other words, which node in the network has the highest degree? To start, I think we should think about the properties of that word. Where would the vowel(s) appear? What consonants would be the most conducive for fitting into many words? Take a second to think. Well if you guessed MARS, then you would be correct. In case you were curious, here are the 32 words that connect to MARS!</p>
									<blockquote>LARS, MARA, MARC, MARI, MARK, SARS, BARS, CARS, EARS, GARS, JARS, OARS, PARS, TARS, VARS, WARS, MFRS, MASS, MAYS, MACS, MADS, MAGS, MAMS, MANS, MAPS, MATS, MAWS, MARX, MARY, MARE, MARL, MART</blockquote>
									<p>That’s pretty good! Mostly words that I can recognize. Looking at the word, we can kind of see what makes it such a strong word for this. Ending with an S introduces a lot of plural three letter words. Additionally, having an R as the third letter is a good consonant, because it can connect to other consonants at the end (I’m not a linguist but this analysis feels right).</p>

									<h2>Repo plug</h2>
									<p>So much fun and so much more to see! With the <a href="https://github.com/ch-lum/Almost-the-same" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>, I left a program to create networks of n-letter words. I’ve only really looked into four and five-letter words, but there’s a lot more to see (what lies in the realm of eight-letter words? Is it a desert, void of connections?). Additionally, as mentioned prior, you can use your own dictionary if the one I’ve been using is too weird for you.</p>

									<h2>Takeaways?</h2>
									<p>At the end of the day, this project taught me a lot. Going into it, I didn’t really know anything about anything. No clue about graphs and all the stuff we can do with that. Even learned about trees, and when not to use them. I’m glad that the question “can I do this?” was answered with “yes, and a whole lot more” because stumbling into discovery was ultimately the best way to keep me engaged with this project. I’m glad I was able to discover and play with the libraries and programs for myself instead of using a sample dataset. It’s easier to care about it. Learning this way showed me a lot from the ground up and there’s a ton more in store for me with graphs and visualization.</p>
									<p>Something that doing it this way was not helpful for, however, was knowing how everything worked. The algorithms are all super cool, but there’s some neat linear algebra going on behind the scenes that get brushed right over. At least I was exposed to it, and perhaps classes in the future will go more in-depth regarding the strategies I used today.</p>
									<p>Anyways, I hope you found this as interesting as I did!</p>
