									<p><i>***This story is taken from an essay written in July 2020***</i></p>

									<p>Dead silence. A few dozen eyes rest upon me. I prepared for this for a couple weeks. <i>I can give a talk about orcas</i> I tell myself. This is my first time doing real, meaningful public speaking in front of a group of strangers. There’s no more than 50 people around but it feels like there’s hundreds. <i>I’ve never done this before</i>. There’s this feeling that swells up before speaking. The tide lowering before the tsunami. A calm before the storm. I hope my speech isn’t a storm. <i>Why did I sign up for this again?</i></p>

									<p>Less than a year ago I had first talked to a guest at the aquarium. I didn’t know much—some aquarium volunteers aspire to be marine biologists or oceanographers and know the ins and outs of fish anatomy or environmental policy. Me? No clue. I’m just here to absorb. And here I am trying to teach this guest about the rockfish we’re looking at. The first time talking to a guest is nerve wracking. They trust that you’re correct. I better be correct. <i>What if I’m not correct? Why did I sign up for this again?</i></p>

									<p>Finally, I start speaking. The pressure that had built up releases. The talking is never as bad as the buildup. I begin the speech with “Our killer whales are dying.” Talking in front of the crowd reminds me of the start of my yearlong aquarium volunteer journey; talking to guests whom I am now so comfortable with. Once, long ago, I did not know how to talk about the aquarium’s fish and that feeling had briefly returned. Ultimately, my first speech was short and rushed; just as my first time interpreting a guest was quiet and awkward. But at least I did it. It was actually pretty fun. I signed up for both and followed through, and I would definitely go and speak again. I had continued volunteering; I have spent each weekend that I could at the aquarium talking to the guests.</p>

									<p>And to answer the question I asked earlier: why not? Why not sign up? Before volunteering, I didn’t have a particular interest in marine science, but I am so glad that I jumped on the opportunity from a friend of a friend. Before speaking, I didn’t have a big drive to expand my marine interest outside the aquarium, but I am so glad to have stopped and signed up after it was briefly mentioned in conversation. Through volunteering I have met so many driven people and had the amazing opportunities they present. They inspired me to go out on my own and give a speech at the local climate strike. With the speech, I dragged some of my friends down and ever since we have had our own little environmental group to go out and learn and lobby together. So why do I sign up for these different activities? Just to learn, I guess.</p>
