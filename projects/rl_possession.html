									<p><strong>December 16, 2023</strong><br>Christopher Lum</p> <!-- Date -->

									<p><i>Chris, as a retired teacher, you telling me that makes me jump for joy on the inside.</i> 
									I got this sweet comment from a colleague of mine when I was telling them about how my fall quarter went. 
									This quarter, I made a staggering realization: use class final projects as portfolio pieces. 
									This revelation should not shock any educators, this is the whole point of some final projects, 
									but as a student who was primarily focused on getting good grades, 
									forgoing the rubric and focusing solely on quality was a daunting jump.</p>

									<p>In fall, I took the class CSE 158: Web Mining and Recommender Systems with Julian McAuley. 
									The course was excellent as a project-based course focused on recommenders which 
									opened my eyes to similarity and SVD-based machine learning models. 
									Our final project was to create a predictor of some sort which perfectly aligned with 
									a project I had been thinking about but never took the time to dive into–a Rocket League position analyzer. 
									So with the assignment as a launchpad, I finally jumped into starting this project with a possession predictor.</p>

									<p>For those who don’t know, <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en">Rocket League</a> is a video game best described as soccer with cars. 
									There is a professional league called the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) 
									where they play in 3v3 matches to win tournaments. 
									My overall goal is to make a model that can grade a team at any point based on their positioning 
									(where their cars are in relation to the others). 
									For this class, I wanted to make a predictor that can solve the following question: 
									based on a given snapshot of a Rocket League match, can a model predict who has possession of the ball?</p>

									<p>This guiding question has several abstractions that I’ll need to address. 
									What does a snapshot of a match look like to a computer? 
									And what will possession look like?</p>

									<h2>Solving Snapshots</h2>

									<p><i>For more in-depth discussion, check out my article on building the dataset.</i></p>

									<p>I need to be able to quantify a Rocket League position, 
									which means that first, I have to get data for my model. 
									I already knew where data for this project was going to come from; 
									All replay files of professional Rocket League matches get saved to a website called 
									<a href="http://Ballchasing.com" target="_blank">Ballchasing.com</a>. Here I can find every single match to use as my dataset. 
									This website was a great start, but Rocket League replay files are saved 
									in a custom file format built for the game itself. 
									I used <a href="https://github.com/tfausak/rattletrap" target="_blank">Rattletrap</a> to parse the replay files into JSON, 
									from which I was able to build my dataset from.</p>

									<p>The final dataset I built for this model has a row for every frame that precedes a goal 
									(frames after the last goal aren’t included) and contains data for each player 
									as well as the ball such as xyz position, velocity, acceleration, and rotational orientation. 
									I passed every match of the 
									<a href="https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/2022-23" target="_blank">RLCS 2023 World Championship</a> 
									into the dataset builder in order to create my training dataset.</p>

									<h2>Pinpointing Possession</h2>
									
									<p>Firstly, I need to define what possession means. 
									The objective of Rocket League at any moment is to score a goal on the opponent’s net. 
									Looking at other sports, possession usually means which team has the next attacking chance. 
									What I need now is a dataset of clear examples of which team is attacking so to create that, 
									I decided to shave down the overall dataset and keep only the frames that were immediately before a goal. 
									Reason being that teams should be the team attacking when they’re scoring a goal.</p>

									<p>I had several ways of shaving the dataset, such as taking the prior N many frames, 
									but instead I defined a quick heuristic based on the direction the ball was traveling and its 
									position right before the goal was scored. 
									I additionally included the team that scored next as the label for each row. 
									After this shaving, I had a dataset that includes the positions of all the objects as well as who has possession of the ball.</p>

									<h2>Model and Outcomes</h2>

									<p>With the dataset built, training a model was fairly straightforward. 
									Most literature on soccer analytics such as expected goals use logistic regression, 
									but I settled on gradient boosting because I didn’t like how logistic regression 
									can’t capture the relationships between two of features. 
									I also considered using an SVM, though the fitting took much longer and wouldn’t be able to provide a probability, 
									something that I wanted just in case.</p>

									<p>In the end, the model achieved 89% accuracy on my test set. 
									I went ahead and used the model on entire games, and I’m quite proud of the model’s predictions. 
									The model can successfully recognize when exactly in a play a team loses possession, 
									such as on an errant pass or a touch that gets away. 
									Looking at the confidence of the model can also tell us some interesting behaviors of the model. 
									Sometimes, the model will waver in confidence when an opponent looks like they’ll have a good challenge, 
									then regain confidence if the opponent takes a poor path to the ball.</p>

									<p>Being able to define the abstractions made in the initial problem allowed me 
									to develop a dataset that has all the pieces that I need. 
									Now, with the model, it’s time to analyze matches! The repo to this project can be found
									<a href="https://github.com/ch-lum/rl-analysis">here</a>.</p>
