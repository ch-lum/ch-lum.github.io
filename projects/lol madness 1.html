									<p><strong>May 18, 2023</strong><br>Christopher Lum</p> <!-- Date -->

									<p>What is my favorite video game? If you guessed <i>League of Legends</i> (for obvious reasons), you'd be... wrong! I hate this game, I say before I get back on with my friends in bronze (we're trying, okay?). My favorite game is Rocket League, but that's for another time.</p>

									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>I'm a big esport person. I follow pretty much every RLCS match and I keep a close eye on League whenever a big tournament rolls around (go G2!). For today, we found a dataset of pro League games played in 2022 and 2023.</p>
									<p>Poking through the dataset in Excel, I first noticed the 150,000 rows of data. That's quite a bit, but nothing too crazy for some Pandas. Jumping ahead a bit, the question we're going to look to answer is <i>Is Zeri/Nautilus better than average in pro play?</i></p>

									<h2>First, the poking</h2>
									<p>Cleaning the data wasn't too rough. My first thoughts when I looked at the data were about the bot lane (which doesn't really make sense and I despise laning and play Rammus instead). Ultimately, I was drawn to any relationships with the champions themselves. The columns I deemed important were "gameid", "side", "position", "champion", and "result". These were really the only relevant columns, as many were stats about the game itself, such as how many kills a player got.</p>
									
									<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table  border=1 class="dataframe alt">
										<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: right;">
												<th>gameid</th>
												<th>side</th>
												<th>position</th>
												<th>champion</th>
												<th>result</th>

									<p>Given these columns, what further cleaning is necessary? Well, luckily for us, not much. Let's look at how much these champions are being used. The following plot is the play count for each champion used in the botlane. As you can see, the top few champions are used in most games. Specifically, nine champions (of 114) represent over 50% of all total champions selected. In addition, Nautilus is the most played champion. Perhaps Nautilus's utility/adaptability is unmatched. Blitzcrank is a similar hook champion, and he is only used 5% as frequently as Nautilus.</p>

									<iframe src="../assets/data/ppcb.html" width=100% height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

									<p>If Nautilus is played so often, he must be good at something. Perhaps Nautilus's winrate is very high. Or perhaps stronger chapmions are banned more frequently, allowing for Nautilus to filter through. The following graph has every botlane champion with more than ten plays showing their play count and ban count. Additionally, the least squares regression between play count and ban count is overlayed.</p>

									<iframe src="../assets/data/wrbc.html" width=100% height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

									<p>If we hover, we can see that Nautilus (highlighted red) <b>doesn't even have a positive win rate</b>. How odd! He's banned pretty frequently too, but not too much of an outlier in that sense. In fact, Nautilus has less bans than expected for a champion with how many plays he has. In fairness, the RÂ² for the linear regression is fairly low. In this plot, there are two big outliers in both directions. Zeri and Nautilus. Would they be very good together?</p>

									<p>Before we get there, lets look at every duo together. For this, we can make a pivot table. If we put all bot lane champions on one axis and all support champions on the other, we can put the count of each champion at the intersection of each champion. However, there are about 30 champions used for each and I'll save you the trouble from looking at that atrociously large table. Instead, here is a scatter plot of the same data, only showing duos who have 25 or more plays.</p>

									<iframe src="../assets/data/pairings.html" width=100% height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
									
									<p>Nautilus looks to have a huge spread of bot lane champions that he plays with. This is opposite of the most played duo, being Lucian/Nami, where outside of their duo, they aren't played too much. Nautilus is probably played as much as he is because he fills a much needed niche the best. He seems to slot well with pretty much every champion.</p>
									
									<h2>Missingness Mechanisms</h2>
									<p>The subset of the data that I'm using, actually has no missing/NaN values. Every column has every row filled and there aren't any missing data based hidden as a String saying "missing", or anything like that. That being said, I looked back to the raw dataset in order to check for missingness mechanisms.</p>
									
									<p>One column that is Not Missing At Random is the "split" column. This is because the column contains information that is dependent on the format each league takes. If a league only has a single, season long split, then the split column may not have information on it. Info that could be beneficial would be merging the raw dataset with a dataset that contians league information, such as number of splits per season for a given league.</p>
									
									<p>One column that is Missing at Random is the "playername" column, as it has the occasional player name "unknown player". If we look at the distribution of the column "league" with and without unknown players, it becomes evident that missing player names are influenced by the league that they are in.</p>
									
									
									<iframe src="../assets/data/ppl.html" width=100% height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
									
									<p>Observing the graph, the biggest leagues (Korea, China, Europe, North America) each have 0 missing names, whereas the smaller leagues (Latin America South, Portugal, Germany) have a disproportionate amount of missing names. Given the null hypothesis that the data is Missing Completely at Random, the given difference in distributions has a probability of occuring < 0.0001. The null distribution and the null statistic is plotted below.</p>
									
									<iframe src="../assets/data/tvds.html" width=100% height=300 frameBorder=0></iframe>
									
									
									<h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
									<p>Back to the fun stuff. Fun fact to start, Zeri is voiced by a Filipino voice actress, the same one who voices Neon in Valorant. I spent the max amount of blue essense on unlocking Zeri for that very reason, and I proceeded to never play her again because she was too weird and I am not a laner. My question is as follows: <i>Is the bot lane combo of Zeri and Nautilus significantly better than the expected 50%?</i></p>
									
									<p><b>Null Hypothesis</b> - Nautilus and Zeri have an expected winrate of 50%</p>
									<p><b>Alternative Hypothesis</b> - Nautilus and Zeri's expected winrate is greater than 50%</p>
									
									<p>For this, the test statistic I used was win rate, or games won divided by games played. This can be thought of as the mean of the results, if wins are 1 and losses are 0. The significance level will be 0.01, because the number of possible bot lane combinations is extremely high (> 26,000 possible, though only 983 combos have been used and only 156 have more than 25 games played), which means a higher alpha value can result in p-hacking.</p>
									
									<iframe src="../assets/data/hypothesis.html" width=100% height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

									<p>Shown above is the null distribution of win rate and the observed win rate for Nautilus and Zeri. The observed win rate is 0.5368, which is higher than Zeri's high win rate of 0.5335. The pair have 326 total games played together, making Nautilus Zeri's second most played with support, but Zeri is Nautilus's fourth most played with bot lane. The resulting p-value from 10,000 simulations is only 0.0905, which being greater than our alpha of 0.01, means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Ultimately, Zeri is only 7% of all of Nautilus's games, which means that even though their 3 points above 50% seems like a significant amount, the variance is likely due to a small sample size.</p>
									
									<h2>FF15</h2>
									<p>So unfortunately, picking the most played and the most banned bot laners doesn't result in free wins. Who would've thunk it. My friend John saw the data and was like "who tf is playing Seraphine/Nautilus". I also ran a hypothesis test on that pair which resulted in nothing substantial. The real shocker was seeing that their win rate is actually positive. I was expecting that duo to be pretty bad. Apparently not though, but both the Koreans and the Chinese know not to play it, so maybe that's the real test of how viable a team comp is. Whether it's run in Asia or not.</p>

									<p>Last note, Rammus was only used in six games. SIX. That makes me sad. Only three other champions have less plays. My day is ruined.</p>
