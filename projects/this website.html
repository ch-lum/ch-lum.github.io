									<p><strong>September 12, 2022</strong><br>Christopher Lum</p> <!-- Date -->

									<p>One thing that always seemed like an important step to showing off a project was the personal website and blog. The exploratory data analysis needs to go somewhere, right? What I didn’t know, however, was the learning curve to making a website. It has shown me a newfound appreciation for something that I had previously despised.</p>
									
									<h2>The Start</h2>
									<p>Going into this project, I figured it wouldn’t be too difficult. I had taught some basic HTML to kids at Code Ninjas, so I was basically a pro! Scratch that, I actually had no idea what I was doing. I mentioned to one of my friends to wish me luck as I was staring at my blank HTML file.</p>
									<p>At this point, I am a complete beginner. I had never really dove into HTML, so I made some pretty simple discoveries as I went along. The first, and probably biggest, thing I discovered was the template. I will admit that I definitely used a template for this website (<a href="https://html5up.net/">link here!</a>) and I have no regrets! To me, starting here instead of with that blank file really helped me create something that I would be proud of, feeling more fulfilled with each step as I could really see it all come together.</p>

									<h2>The Middle</h2>
									<p>Progressing on the website comes by smoothly. With it, I can start creating the content that I want and it’s all public for the world to see. My first blog, <i><a href="almost the same.html">Almost the Same</a></i>, came out pretty long because I really got into writing about each step of that journey and displaying my thought process. Something I’ve learned when making these is that writing about myself in a low stakes environment is actually pretty calming and something I found myself enjoying a lot. Being able to take a more relaxed tone reduced the stress of writing as compared to the old argumentative papers I became accustomed to in high school. I’m happy to continue to grow this website and I appreciate the foundation that I am now resting upon.</p>
									<p>I definitely surprised myself with how much I thought about this website. I loved coming up with new features and little details to for it and scouring the internet for help on the weirdly specific thing I’m looking for was really satisfying. The thing I’m the proudest about is actually the little image of the bottom of the ocean in the footer (I’m calling it the anchor for obvious reasons). It took a little bit of time to figure out, but after coming up with the discreet ocean theme and creating the graphic and implementing it at the bottom, I had a little detail that made me happy to look at the bottom of each page. </p>

									<h2>The Future</h2>
									<p>Now that I have built this foundation, I’m looking forwards to sharing my projects and writing more. More than that, it took a bit of a backseat in this post, but the HTML skills I have acquired is hopefully the start of me taking those tools and using them to round out my repertoire in my data science journey. </p>
									<p>Thank you for reading through this little update!</p>
